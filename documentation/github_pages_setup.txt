Hello World set-up
- create a public repo named [username].github.io (where username is your username)
- clone the repo locally
- add index.html with some text to be displayed inside
- git add, commit, and push the change
- now visible at https://username.github.io (for me https://nethanmsanchez.github.io)

React Hello World set-up
- use the same repo created in the previous "Hello World set-up"
- copy the react code to the repo from a create-react-app
- inside the folder with the react code run: $ npm run build
- then copy all of the contents of the auto created build folder into the main repo (not in any folder)
    - this step and the one before can be added to a script in package.json for convenience
- git add, commit, and push and done



To update the pages:
- from nethanmsanchez.github.io(master)/source:
    - run $ npm run deploy
    - commit and push all changes with
        - $ git add -A
        - $ git commit -m "message"
        - $ git push
        (ssh pass : Ss...14...)
