During the first 5 years of my life I lived in large trailer park with my Mom and two sisters.    My sisters and I would spend a lot of time outside playing in our yard often climbing the    cherry and peach trees as well as picking and eating cherries, peaches, figs, raspberries, and black     berries. In 6th grade we moved into an apartment that was a lot closer to our school and had a bunch of     kids of all ages living nearby. During this time I practically lived outside doing all sorts of things     like playing basketball, football, soccer, tetherball, freeze tag, cops and robbers, racing, skateboarding     and countless other games. On most weekends and summer breaks my younger sister and I would spend time with     our uncles doing things like going to church, bowling, mini golf, swimming, as well going on trips to Disneyland     and Yosemite. When I was starting high school we moved again into a house near where I would be going to school.    During my Freshman year, when not doing homework or chores, I would pass the time playing basketball with friends,     riding my bike, and playing video games like Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic, BattleFront, and     The Simpsons Hit and Run on my Xbox. During my Softmore year I started playing tennis, quickly becoming obsessed,     and would play any chance I could. By my senior year I was the number one tennis player at my high school."," Ever since I started Parks and Rec basketball in second grade I have been captivated by the game, both    watching NBA and playing in intramurals and open gym. There are very few things that could get me to pass up a good    pickup game of basketball. While I enjoy most sports in general, a close second to basketball is tennis which I began    playing in High school.",' I first began reading for entertainment in 6th grade when I read the "Series of Unfortunate Events"     to try and win the Accelerated Reading prize. I quickly moved on to other books like the "Harry Potter" and     "Hunger Games" series\'. During High School and into college my reading for fun died down because I was having to     read a lot for school. But more recently I\'ve began reading again and have enjoyed the "Throne of Glass" series, "Ready Player One",     and "Guns, Germs, and Steel." '," I've only started cooking relatively recently, after working in a kitchen store called Sur La Table right     after graduating and moving back to the Sacramento area from college. Some of my favorite dishes to make (and eat) are     Carnitas, Baked Lasagna, Paprika Chicken & Rice, and Dutch Oven no Knead Bread.",'Watching: Another one of my hobbies is watching movies and tv shows. Some of my favorite movies are     "The Lord of The Rings", "Harry Potter", "Star Wars", "Back to the Future", and "The Patriot"     Some of the shows I\'ve discovered recently include "The Americans", "Justified", "The Mandalorian",     "Stranger Things", "The Office", and "The Witcher".'," I went to April Lane Elementary School from K-5 grades. From what I remember I got good grades    and really liked my school and teachers.",' I went to Gray Avenue Middle School from 6-8 grades. I took the bus to school, played on the school    basketball and flag football teams, and held the "Commisioner of Athletics" position my 8th grade year.     I really liked Middle School and it may be my favorite school that I\'ve been to. In Middle School I got very good grades,     disovered my knack for math and science, and my adversion to Writing.'," I went to Yuba City High School all four years, and graduated in the class of 2015. High school     was definitely my least favorite, but started out low and eventually became more enjoyable. I got pretty good     grades in high school, and discovered my interests in history, chemistry, Gov/Econ, and Physics. During my Sophmore     year I started playing tennis which quickly became a big part of my life during that time. I graduated from Yuba City High School in 2015."," Fortunately I was able to get enough grants and loans to attend UC Santa Cruz for all four years of undergrad, and graduated in 2019 with     my Bachelor's in Computer Science. I originally went in as a Computer Engineering major after doing an online     career matching activity in my AVID class in high school. Shortly into it I realized that I was much more interested     in the software side of things than the hardware and decided to pursue Computer Science. I spent the first year     living in the dorms which was definitely an amazing learning experience. My last three years I lived on campus     with friends I met in the dorms and classes, which had much more room but were a lot harder to reach campus from     and very expensive. All in all college was an incredible experience that taught me many new skills, life lessons,     and perspectives that would be difficult to learn any other way than moving away to college at 18.","This project is intended to be used by hiring managers to see some of my personality, experience, and abilities. It will    also be one place to find personal links like my LinkedIn, GitHub and the Fantasy Trade Analyzer Project, my resume,    and cover letter.","This project was created using React (create-react-app), and served statically with GitHub Pages. It Could have been     created with just html and css but I chose to use React to get more practice with it.","This project took about one month of total time, including planning, gathering and updating resources. It took a little     bit of time to get the webpage to show up when using React, but eventually discovered to build the files, and then     move them into the main project level. Some skills that I was able to work on during this project were     using version control, keeping up with documentation, UI design, and ReactJS.      I was using multiple branches and merging to practice proper workflow when working with a team of developers.     I made sure to keep up with a daily working log, keep track of all packages used and where they came from, and     using comments in my code to improve my project organization and productivity. I spent time learning useful     css properties and made sure to make a UI that looks good on all screen sizes, including phones. I chose React     over basic html and css, which would have been a little faster, so that I could get more practice with it.","The main purpose of the Fantasy Trade Analyzer was to learn the MERN (MongoDb, Express, React, NodeJS) stack.     But I also wanted to create something that I would actually want to use myself and related to something I enjoy     outside of programming. I thought the Fantasy Trade Analyzer would achieve both of these criteria as well as allow     me to learn webscraping and not be too ambitious to actually finish solo.","I started by following a MongoDB tutorial to open up a cluster, load sample data, connect to a NodeJS project,     and perform CRUD operations. Once I completed that, I followed various tutorials to learn to webscrape using Axios,     and got the data stored in the db. I then followed another MongoDB tutorial for most of the project, as well various     others for specific things like Heroku deployment and Media Queries for an adaptive UI.","This project took about 2 and half months to complete from start to finish although for about half of the time was spent     taking notes and reading up on React, NodeJS, Express, CSS, and webscraping with Axios. Some things worked much easier     than others, some of the things that seemed to work effortlessly were connecting to MongoDB and getting the CRUD operations     to work, getting the Media Queries to work, and creating the React components. On the other hand a few things that gave     me some trouble were webscraping the data with Axios, getting the first api calls to successfully return usable data, and     getting it deployed.","This project was created as a final in my Mobile Applications course at UCSC, in a group with 2 other classmates.     For our final project we created an Android application with the purpose of helping an organization on campus conduct waste     audits to analyze the amounts of cross contamination in each waste stream across campus. They primarily wanted an app     created so that they could have an efficient and easy to use UI, so that anyone could open the app and be guided through     the process of conducting a waste audit. Some other features that they wanted were some sort of auth so that only those with     a ucsc email address could access it, some basic data visualization, and a free cloud stored db.","Our group chose  to split the work into three fairly equal parts, the db api and google auth code, the data visualization,     and the UI/Waste Audit functionality. I was responsible for designing and coding the Java Classes and methods we used and creating all of the fragments     used for the actual Waste Audit functionality. We used Firebase for the database, Google auth for auth, and Android Studio/Java as the IDE.","This project gave me invaluable experience, a lot of which wasn't even code related. I learned how to communicate technical information with     a real world product owner, working with other developers on a project simultaneously, and of course a ton about Android
